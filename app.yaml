# required field, will be used to generate the project directory name
name: "Laravel Hub"

# The idea is we would set this in the composer.json file and to show in the UI of Laravel Hub
description: "A Laravel application"

# The idea here is that we can extend a recipe and add our own steps
extend: "laravel/livewire-volt"

# The idea here is that we can set env variables that will be used in the steps
env: 
  APP_RANDOM_KEY: "9876543210"

# should we use steps for this? Inspired by Github Actions
steps: 

  - name: "test env upserts"
    env: 
      APP_NAME: "Laravel Hub 2"

  - name: "test env upserts 2"
    env: 
      APP_NAME: "Laravel Hub 3 - should this override the previous env?"
